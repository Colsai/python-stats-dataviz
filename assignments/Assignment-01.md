Assignment #01
Create a program that does the following:

Prompts a user to enter 10 integers.
If the user enters anything other than integers, remind her that only integers are allowed and let her retry.
Don't allow the user to enter more than 10 or less than 10 numbers.
Display the 10 numbers back to the user at the end.
Calculate the following statistics from the 10 numbers entered:

- Minimum
- Maximum
- Range
- Mean
- Variance
- Standard Deviation

Note:

Use the basic Python concepts and methods. Special Python libraries such as statistics, scipy, or numpy are not allowed.
You may need to use 
- loops (finite and/or infinite loop)
- break/continue
- try/except
- input() function 
- int() function

Implement this in two ways and produce and submit two different files:
- Produce a Python script (.py).
- Produce a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb).

Provide good comments/documentations in both the Python script (use comments) and the Jupyter Notebook (use Markdown and comments).
