Create a program that does the following:

* Prompts a user to enter 10 numbers.
If the user enters anything other than numbers, remind her that only numbers are allowed and let her retry.
Don't allow the user to enter more than 10 or less than 10 numbers.
Display the 10 numbers back to the user at the end.
Calculate the following statistics from the 10 numbers entered:
Minimum
Maximum
Range 
Mean
Median (optional)
Mode (optional)
Variance (optional)
Standard Deviation (optional)
Note:

Use the Python concepts and methods covered so far. Try not to use uncovered methods.
Use infinite loop: while True
Use break/continue
Use try/except
Implement this in two ways and produce and submit two different files:
Produce a Python script (.py). You may implement it using Spyder or any code editor. - Optional
Produce a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb). You may use Jupyter Notebook on your laptop or any hosted environment such as Google Colab and Kaggle.
