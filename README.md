# Statistical Analysis and Data Visualization with Python
Learn Statistical Analysis, Data Visualization, and Python Programming All in One Place with Hands-on Practices.
I don't focus on syntax or mechanics. I teach students how to learn a subject on their own. I offer no fishes nor fishing gears. I show students where and how to find them. Simply put, "Google Search" is the trick and is what I teach.
