# Statistical Analysis and Data Visualization with Python
## Course Summary
Statistical Analysis, Data Visualization, and Python Programming All in One Place with Hands-on Practices. 
## Data Visualization Five Steps
- Define Data (Source, structure, and elements)
- Tidy up Data (Normalize "messy" data so that is is "Tidy" and ready for next step)
- Transform Data (Wrangle, munge, cleanse, etc.)
- Summarize Data (Summary/descriptive statistics)
- Visualize Data 

Check out this [paper](file:///C:/Users/cjwang/Downloads/v59i10.pdf) for data tidying.

All five steps must be guided by domain knowledge, purpose, and principles. 
## My Pedagogy
- I put practice above PowerPoint. I don't focus on syntax and mechanics.
- I share with students how I learn. I show them how to learn on their own so that they become life-long learners without relying on teachers or gurus. 
- I offer no fishes nor fishing gears. I show students where and how to find them.
- The Internet is the biggest fish pond and Google is the best fishing gear. 
- Curiocity may kill a cat, it sure makes a student.
