# Statistical Analysis and Data Visualization with Python
Online Class WebEx: http://umbc.webex.com/meet/jaywang
## Course Summary
Statistical Analysis, Data Visualization, and Python Programming All in One Place with Hands-on Practices. 
## Data Visualization Five Steps
- Define Data (Source, structure, and elements)
- Tidy up Data (Normalize "messy" data so that is is "Tidy" and ready for next step)
- Transform Data (Wrangle, munge, cleanse, etc.)
- Summarize Data (Summary/descriptive statistics)
- Visualize Data 

Check out this [paper](https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v059i10) for data tidying.

All five steps must be guided by domain knowledge, purpose, and principles. 

## Data Visualization - Plots/Charts
- One Variable
   - Categorical Variable (frequency table)
       - Bar chart/Pareto Chart (sorted)
       - Pie Chart (Avoid it when there are two many categories)
   - Numerical Variable (discrete or continuous, frequency distribution)
       - Histogram
       - Line Chart (time series data)
   - Textual Variable/Data
       - Wordcloud
- Multiple variables
   - Two categorical variables (contingency table, pivot table)
       - Stacked Bar Chart
       - Grouped Bar Chart
   - Two numerical variables
       - Scatter Plot
       - Bubble Chart (Scatter plot with varying size of dots based on the third numerical variable)
       - Motion Chart (Interactive scatter plot reflecting the trend on a third time series categorical variable such as quarter, month)
       - Scatter Plot with varying colors and Shapes of dots/marks reflecting additional categorical variables (dimensions)
## My Pedagogy
- I put practice above PowerPoint. I don't focus on syntax and mechanics.
- I share with students how I learn. I show them how to learn on their own so that they become life-long learners without relying on teachers or gurus. 
- I offer no fishes nor fishing gears. I show students where and how to find them.
- The Internet is the biggest fish pond and Google is the best fishing gear. 
- Curiocity may kill a cat, it sure makes a student.
